            <p className="profile-description">I am a passionate software engineer with three years of experience specializing in iOS app development using both SwiftUI and UIKit. My journey in technology is complemented by a rich background in psychology, which enhances my approach to building user-centric mobile and web applications.

                                                Beyond my professional life, I have been deeply involved in soccer, a sport Iâ€™ve played all my life. As an ardent supporter of Chelsea FC, the game continues to be a significant part of my life.
                                                Originally from New York with a proud Jamaican heritage, I have also been influenced by my English roots through my father.
                                                <br></br>
                                                <br></br>
                                                 My educational path took me to Johnson & Wales University, and I am currently advancing my knowledge at Stevens Institute of Technology.
                                                Family is incredibly important to me, and my 9-month-old child brings immense joy to my life. In my free time, I indulge in Muay Thai, boxing, Jiu-Jitsu, MMA, playing and watching soccer, and of course, coding. I am also a member of Kappa Alpha Pis Fraternity Inc.
